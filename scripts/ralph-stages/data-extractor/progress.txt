# Data Extractor Progress

## Codebase Patterns

- Always analyze DOM structure FIRST with chrome_evaluate before writing extraction code
- Use category_detector.py for ALL mod categorization (never hardcode)
- Extract builds + mods in single pass for efficiency
- Output to JSONL format (one record per line)
