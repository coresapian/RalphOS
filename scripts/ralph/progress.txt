## Codebase Patterns (Reusable Knowledge)

### URL Discovery
- Always check for pagination (numeric pages, "load more" buttons, infinite scroll)
- Normalize URLs: remove fragments (#), trailing slashes, and duplicates
- Save intermediate results every 50 URLs to prevent data loss
- Use set() for deduplication before writing to urls.json

### HTML Scraping
- Always set User-Agent header to avoid basic bot detection
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Save HTML to `{output_dir}/html/{slug}.html` format
- Use filename sanitization: replace special chars, limit to 200 chars

### Build Extraction
- Use schema at `schema/build_extraction_schema.json` as reference
- Required fields: build_id, source_type, build_type, build_source, source_url, year, make, model
- Generate build_id with: `python scripts/tools/build_id_generator.py {source_url}`
- Set extraction_confidence based on completeness of extracted data

### Mod Extraction
- Use `category_detector.py` for automatic categorization
- Categories come from `schema/Vehicle_Componets.json`
- Include brand extraction when identifiable from mod name
- Calculate modification_level: Stock (0-1), Light (2-5), Moderate (6-15), Heavy (16+)

### Anti-Bot Handling
- If 403/429 errors occur, mark source as "blocked" in sources.json
- Use stealth_scraper.py for blocked sources
- Rate limit: minimum 1 second between requests per source

### File Structure
- urls.json: `{"urls": [], "lastUpdated": "ISO8601", "totalCount": N}`
- builds.json: `{"builds": [...], "metadata": {...}}`
- mods.json: `{"mods": [...], "metadata": {...}}`
- scrape_progress.json: tracks completed/failed URLs
