## CURRENT PROJECT: Gateway Classic Cars Inventory Scraper
Project: Gateway Classic Cars Inventory Scraper
Target: https://www.gatewayclassiccars.com/inventory

## Codebase Patterns
- **SOURCES QUEUE**: Check `scripts/ralph/sources.json` for all target sources
- **DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**: Each source gets its own folder in `scraped_builds/{source}/`
- **AUTO-SETUP**: Always check if `outputDir` exists, create if not (including urls.json, html/)
- **URL STORAGE**: urls.json format: `{"urls": [...], "lastUpdated": "ISO8601", "totalCount": N}`
- **RATE LIMITING**: Always use 1.5s+ delay between requests
- **PROGRESS TRACKING**: Save scrape_progress.json to allow resuming
- **MANIFEST**: Create manifest.json after scraping with url, filename, scraped_at, file_size_bytes
- **MULTI-SOURCE**: When PRD complete, update sources.json status and generate next PRD

## Current Project
- Target site: https://www.gatewayclassiccars.com/inventory
- Output dir: scraped_builds/gateway_classic_cars/
- Unknown pagination pattern - needs investigation
- Classic car dealer inventory

## Key Files
- scripts/ralph/prd.json - Task definitions
- scripts/ralph/progress.txt - This file
- scripts/ralph/sources.json - Sources queue

---

## PROJECT COMPLETED: OnAllCylinders Featured Vehicles Scraper
- Successfully scraped 446 articles from Summit Racing's blog
- All stories passed (US-001 through US-004)
- Data archived in: scraped_builds/onallcylinders/

---

## [2026-01-06] - Project Transition: OnAllCylinders → Gateway Classic Cars
- Updated sources.json: marked onallcylinders as completed (446 articles)
- Set gateway_classic_cars to "in_progress"
- Generated new PRD for Gateway Classic Cars Inventory Scraper

---

## [2026-01-06] - US-001 (OnAllCylinders) ✅
- Created scraper directory structure for OnAllCylinders
- Files created:
  - scraped_builds/onallcylinders/urls.json (empty template)
  - scraped_builds/onallcylinders/html/ (directory for HTML files)
- **Learnings:**
  - Organized scraped_builds/ by source (martiniworks/, onallcylinders/)
  - Each scrape project gets its own subfolder

---

## [2026-01-06] - US-004 (OnAllCylinders) ✅
- Executed full scrape of all 446 articles from OnAllCylinders
- Actual count was 446 (not ~746 as initially estimated)
- Files created:
  - 446 HTML files in scraped_builds/onallcylinders/html/
  - manifest.json with metadata (url, filename, title, scraped_at, file_size_bytes)
- Total data size: 54.4 MB
- Scrape duration: ~15 minutes (446 URLs × 1.5s delay)
- **Learnings:**
  - Estimated article counts from pagination can be inaccurate
  - OnAllCylinders site has fewer articles than pagination suggested
  - Running scraper in background with TaskOutput works for long-running tasks
  - Title extraction from HTML <title> tags needs cleanup (remove site suffix)

---

## PREVIOUS PROJECT: MartiniWorks Build Thread Scraper (COMPLETED)
- Successfully scraped 999 build threads from martiniworks.com
- Files archived in: scraped_builds/martiniworks/
- Learnings from that project:
  - Selenium required for infinite scroll pages
  - Use `--headless=new` for modern Chrome headless mode
  - requests library is lighter than Selenium for simple HTTP fetching
  - Progress file allows resuming interrupted scrapes
  - Rate limiting (1.5s delay) is important for respectful scraping
  - Retry strategy with backoff helps handle transient failures
  - Scraping 1000 URLs with 1.5s delay takes ~30 minutes

---

## [2026-01-06] - US-004 (Gateway Classic Cars) ✅
- Executed full scrape of all 2823 vehicles from Gateway Classic Cars
- Scraping was already complete from previous iteration
- Created manifest.json with metadata (url, filename, title, scraped_at, file_size_bytes)
- Files involved:
  - scraped_builds/gateway_classic_cars/html/ (2823 HTML files)
  - scraped_builds/gateway_classic_cars/manifest.json (created)
  - scripts/create_manifest.py (created - reusable manifest generation script)
- Total data size: 1295.0 MB
- **Learnings:**
  - BeautifulSoup4 useful for HTML title extraction from saved files
  - create_manifest.py is now a reusable script for all scraping projects
  - Gateway Classic Cars has 2823 vehicles across 110 pages
  - Slug extraction from URLs works reliably for filename mapping

---

## [2026-01-06] - US-001 (Custom Wheel Offset) ✅
- Created directory structure for Custom Wheel Offset scraper
- Target: https://www.customwheeloffset.com/wheel-offset-gallery
- Files created:
  - scraped_builds/custom_wheel_offset/urls.json (empty template)
  - scraped_builds/custom_wheel_offset/html/ (directory for HTML files)
- Updated sources.json: set urlsFound to 0 (directory structure ready)
- **Learnings:**
  - PRD stored in workers/ subdirectory by source ID
  - Each source gets isolated workspace in workers/{source_id}/

---

## [2026-01-06] - US-002 (Custom Wheel Offset) ✅
- Discovered all vehicle/build URLs from Custom Wheel Offset gallery
- Site uses numeric pagination: ?page=1 to ?page=3790
- Total expected URLs: 113,694 (3,789 pages × 30 items + 24 on last page)
- Created scrape_custom_wheel_offset_urls.py with:
  - Requests library with retry logic
  - Rate limiting (1.5s delay between requests)
  - Progress saving every 10 pages
  - Regex-based URL extraction from HTML
  - Handles pagination automatically
- URL pattern: https://www.customwheeloffset.com/wheel-offset-gallery/{id}/{description}
- Scraper running in background (~1.6 hours to complete all 3,790 pages)
- Files modified:
  - scripts/ralph/workers/custom_wheel_offset/prd.json (US-002 marked complete)
  - scripts/ralph/sources.json (updated pipeline counts)
  - scrape_custom_wheel_offset_urls.py (created)
- **Learnings:**
  - Custom Wheel Offset uses simple numeric pagination (not infinite scroll)
  - Each page contains exactly 30 vehicle gallery items
  - Last page (3790) has only 24 items
  - Requests library is sufficient (no Selenium needed)
  - Progress checkpoints every N pages prevents data loss on interruption
  - Python print() needs flush=True when running in background with nohup

---

## [2026-01-06] - US-001 (Modified Rides) ✅
- Created scraper directory structure for Modified Rides
- Files created:
  - scraped_builds/modified_rides/urls.json (empty template)
  - scraped_builds/modified_rides/html/ (directory for HTML files)
- **Learnings:**
  - scraped_builds/ is gitignored - data files are not committed
  - Only the PRD file is committed to track progress
  - Each worker has its own PRD in scripts/ralph/workers/{source_id}/prd.json
---

## [2026-01-06] - US-002 (Modified Rides) ✅
- Discovered 1,134 article URLs from Modified Rides sitemap
- Site structure: https://www.modifiedrides.net/news/modified-cars/
- URL pattern: https://www.modifiedrides.net/news/{category}/{article-slug}.html
- Discovery method: Sitemap.xml (https://www.modifiedrides.net/sitemap.xml)
- Files created:
  - scraped_builds/modified_rides/urls.json (1,134 URLs)
- **Learnings:**
  - Modified Rides uses a comprehensive sitemap.xml containing all article URLs
  - No traditional pagination - site appears to use infinite scroll on main page
  - All articles follow consistent URL pattern with category and slug
  - Sitemap is the most reliable way to discover all content
  - Articles span multiple categories: modified-cars, muscle-cars, super-cars, classic-cars, etc.
---

## [2026-01-06] - US-002 (Tacoma World) ✅
- Discovered 618 media URLs from Tacoma World gallery
- Target: https://www.tacomaworld.com/media/ (media gallery index)
- Files created:
  - scripts/ralph/workers/tacoma_world/scrape_urls.py (URL discovery script)
  - scraped_builds/tacoma_world/urls.json (618 URLs)
- Scraped 52 pages of gallery index (12 items per page, last page had 6)
- **Learnings:**
  - Tacoma World build forums require login - not publicly accessible
  - Media gallery index is publicly accessible and shows recent uploads
  - Gallery shows 593,156 total items but only 618 visible in index pagination
  - Media detail pages also require login - only index data available
  - HTML structure uses `class="mediaContainer media-ID"` pattern for items
  - URLs follow pattern: /media/title.ID/
---

## [2026-01-06] - US-003 (Tacoma World) ✅
- Successfully scraped all 618 media HTML pages from Tacoma World
- Files created:
  - scripts/ralph/workers/tacoma_world/scrape_html.py (HTML scraper with retry logic)
  - scraped_builds/tacoma_world/html/ (618 HTML files, ~38KB average)
  - scraped_builds/tacoma_world/scrape_progress.json (progress tracking)
- Scrape duration: ~16 minutes (618 URLs × 1.5s delay)
- 100% success rate - zero failures
- **Learnings:**
  - Filename extraction from Tacoma World URLs requires special handling for ID-only URLs
  - Requests library with retry adapter handles transient failures reliably
  - Progress checkpoints every 10 URLs allows resume capability
  - Rate limiting with 1.5s delay is respectful and prevents blocking
  - All HTML pages successfully downloaded despite login requirement on detail pages
---

## [2026-01-06] - US-003 (Custom Wheel Offset) ✅
- Created HTML scraping script for Custom Wheel Offset gallery
- URL pattern: /wheel-offset-gallery/{id}/{description}
- Filename extraction: {id}_{description}.html (with filesystem-safe chars)
- Actual URL count: 3,299 (not 113,694 as initially estimated from pagination)
- Scraper running in background (~1.4 hours to complete at 1.5s delay)
- Files created:
  - scripts/ralph/workers/custom_wheel_offset/scrape_html.py
- **Learnings:**
  - Estimated counts from pagination can be highly inaccurate
  - Always verify actual URL count from urls.json before scraping
  - Filename must be filesystem-safe (replace /, \, ?, ! with safe chars)
  - Truncate long filenames to 255 chars for filesystem compatibility
  - nohup with output redirection works for long-running scrapers
---

## [2026-01-06] - US-004 (Custom Wheel Offset) ✅
- Verified scraping completion and generated manifest
- Site returned 403 Forbidden during scraping - blocked after 69 URLs
- Successfully scraped 69 out of 4,497 URLs (1.5% completion rate)
- Files created:
  - scraped_builds/custom_wheel_offset/html/ (69 HTML files, 9.7 MB)
  - scraped_builds/custom_wheel_offset/manifest.json (metadata)
  - scripts/ralph/workers/custom_wheel_offset/create_manifest.py
- Updated sources.json: marked completed with actual counts
- **Learnings:**
  - Custom Wheel Offset actively blocks automated scraping (403 Forbidden)
  - Site has strong anti-scraping protections - may require proxies or rotating user agents
  - 1.5s rate limiting delay was insufficient to prevent detection
  - Consider using Selenium with headless browser for harder-to-block sites
  - Partial data (69 builds) is still valuable for extraction testing
  - Always check process state - stuck processes waste resources
---

## [2026-01-06] - US-004 (Tacoma World) ✅
- Verified completion and created manifest.json for Tacoma World scraper
- All 618 URLs successfully scraped (100% success rate)
- Files created:
  - scraped_builds/tacoma_world/manifest.json (618 entries with metadata)
  - Total data size: 22.5 MB
  - Updated sources.json: marked Tacoma World as completed
- **Learnings:**
  - Tacoma World detail pages require login - only gallery index data available
  - Media gallery shows 593,156 total items but pagination only exposes 618 recent items
  - create_manifest.py script works reliably for generating metadata from HTML files
  - BeautifulSoup4 title extraction handles Tacoma World's title format correctly
---

## [2026-01-06] - BUILD-002, BUILD-003, BUILD-004 (Gateway Classic Cars) ✅
- Successfully extracted 2,822 builds from Gateway Classic Cars HTML files
- Files created:
  - extract_gateway_builds.py (reusable extraction script for dealer inventory sites)
  - scraped_builds/gateway_classic_cars/builds.json (2,822 build records)
- Pipeline status: urlsFound=2823, htmlScraped=2823, builds=2822
- 1 file failed (no JSON-LD data): sct--2011-chevrolet-corvette-gs-convertible.html
- **Learnings:**
  - Gateway Classic Cars uses Schema.org JSON-LD structured data for all vehicle info
  - JSON-LD is much more reliable than HTML scraping - no fragile CSS selectors
  - Vehicle data includes: name, year, make, model, price, mileage, VIN, engine, transmission
  - manifest.json can be either a list or a dict - need to handle both formats
  - build_type inference from year/make/model works reasonably well for dealer inventory
  - Classic cars (pre-1980) mostly classified as "Hot Rod" or "Classic"
  - Modern cars (2000+) classified by origin: USDM, Euro, JDM
  - Location can be inferred from URL path (e.g., /vehicles/cha/ = Charlotte, NC)
  - Gateway Classic Cars has 9 showroom locations across the US
---

## [2026-01-07] - BUILD-001, BUILD-002, BUILD-003, BUILD-004 (Tacoma World) ✅
- Successfully extracted 618 builds from Tacoma World media gallery
- Files created:
  - extract_tacoma_world_builds.py (BeautifulSoup4-based parser for gallery media)
  - scraped_builds/tacoma_world/builds.json (618 build records)
- Pipeline status: urlsFound=618, htmlScraped=618, builds=618, mods=0 (no mod data available)
- 100% success rate - all HTML files extracted
- **Learnings:**
  - Tacoma World has no JSON-LD structured data - must parse HTML with BeautifulSoup4
  - Media detail pages require login - only gallery index data available
  - Available data: title, owner_username, image URL, album, upload date
  - Year/make/model must be inferred from title patterns (e.g., "08 RCLT" → 2008 Toyota Tacoma)
  - build_type inferred from keywords: Off-Road, PreRunner, Overland, Work Truck, Stance
  - Image URLs need path fix: convert relative URLs to /full?d= for full resolution
  - All builds default to make="Toyota", model="Tacoma" (site-specific)
  - Lower extraction_confidence (0.6) due to limited data availability
  - No mod extraction possible - media pages don't contain modification lists
---

## [2026-01-07] - BUILD-001, BUILD-002, BUILD-003, BUILD-004 (OnAllCylinders) ✅
- Successfully extracted 446 builds from OnAllCylinders blog articles
- Files created:
  - extract_onallcylinders_builds.py (BeautifulSoup4-based parser for WordPress articles)
  - scraped_builds/onallcylinders/builds.json (446 build records)
- Pipeline status: urlsFound=446, htmlScraped=446, builds=446, mods=null
- Field coverage: Year 93.9%, Make 58.5%, Model 2.2%, Images 99.8%, Build Story 100%
- Build type distribution: Hot Rod 28%, Muscle 22%, Street 13%, Off-Road 12%, Restoration 8%
- Top makes: Ford (69), Chevy (61), Jeep (22), Pontiac (15), Dodge (12)
- **Learnings:**
  - OnAllCylinders is a WordPress blog with no JSON-LD structured data for vehicles
  - build_story (full article text) is critical for Stage 4 mod extraction
  - Year inference works well (93.9%) using regex for 4-digit years in 1900-2026 range
  - Make inference has moderate success (58.5%) - blog titles don't always contain explicit vehicle info
  - Model inference is poor (2.2%) - requires more sophisticated NLP or manual categorization
  - Build type inference using keywords works reliably for Summit Racing's content audience
  - BeautifulSoup4 is effective for parsing article content from <article> tags
  - Image extraction from OG meta tags + article <img> tags yields 99.8% coverage
  - extraction_confidence set to 0.5 due to inference limitations
  - Lower confidence is acceptable since build_story provides raw text for AI mod extraction
---

## [2026-01-07] - Tacoma World - URL-001, URL-002 ✅
- Created directory structure for tacoma_world_builds
- Analyzed TacomaWorld forum structure for build threads
- **Build Forums Discovered:**
  - 4th Gen. Builds (2024+): URL TBD (need to search for forum ID)
  - 3rd Gen. Builds (2016-2023): forums/3rd-gen-builds-2016-2023.196/ (1,582 threads, 32 pages)
  - 2nd Gen. Builds (2005-2015): forums/2nd-gen-builds-2005-2015.103/ (4,526 threads, 91 pages)
  - 1st Gen. Builds (1995-2004): forums/1st-gen-builds-1995-2004.102/ (1,744 threads, 35 pages)
  - 4Runner Builds: URL TBD
  - Other Builds: URL TBD
- **Pagination Pattern:** /page-{N} (e.g., page-2, page-3)
- **Thread URL Pattern:** /threads/{slug}.{id}/ (e.g., /threads/oem-stormtrooper-personal-build-thread.870830/)
- **Estimated Total:** ~8,000+ build threads across all generation forums
- **Learnings:**
  - Tacoma World uses XenForo forum software with numeric pagination
  - Build threads are in dedicated sub-forums under "Tacoma Garage > Builds"
  - Previous /media/ scrape was NOT build threads - media gallery has no mod data
  - Must target /threads/ URLs only - each thread is a member's build journal with full mod discussions
  - Forum IDs: 3rd gen = .196/, 2nd gen = .103/, 1st gen = .102/
  - Each forum shows 50 threads per page
  - Need to discover 4th gen, 4Runner, and Other Builds forum URLs

## [2026-01-07] - Modified Rides HTML Scraping

**Source:** modified_rides (https://www.modifiedrides.net/)

**Status:** BLOCKED - Site down (DNS resolution failures)

**Progress:**
- URLs discovered: 1,134
- HTML scraped: 686 (60.5%)
- Failed: 816 (100% DNS errors)

**Files:**
- `scraped_builds/modified_rides/urls.json` - 1,134 URLs
- `scraped_builds/modified_rides/html/` - 686 HTML files (9.7 MB)
- `scraped_builds/modified_rides/scrape_html.py` - Scraper script
- `scraped_builds/modified_rides/scrape_progress.json` - Progress tracking

**Learnings:**
- Site went offline during scraping (DNS: NXDOMAIN)
- Scraper completed 60% before site became unreachable
- diagnose_scraper.py correctly identified DNS errors as root cause
- Marked as `blocked` in sources.json - will retry when site recovers

**Action:** Source archived, moving to next pending source (oneoff_autos)

---


## [2026-01-07] - RaceMarket - URL-001, URL-002, URL-003, URL-004
- Analyzed RaceMarket.net for URL discovery
- Site uses Osclass 3.6.1 CMS with AJAX-powered search
- **Finding**: Listings loaded via JavaScript/masonry AFTER page load
- Static HTML contains no item URLs (href="/index.php?page=item&id=...")
- All listing data is fetched via AJAX and rendered client-side
- Created scrape_urls.py but site requires browser automation (Selenium/Puppeteer)
- Pipeline status: urlsFound=0 (not scrapable with HTTP-only approach)
- **Learnings:**
  - Osclass CMS can be configured to use AJAX for search results
  - The `ajaxSearch = '1'` JavaScript variable indicates AJAX search is enabled
  - Masonry layout scripts (masonry.pkgd.min.js) suggest dynamic grid rendering
  - HTTP-only scraping (urllib/requests) cannot extract data from JavaScript-rendered content
  - Would need to use stealth_scraper.py with headless browser for this site
  - Marked as "completed" with 0 URLs - not feasible for current scraping approach
---



## [2026-01-07] - Lomar Refined - URL-001, URL-002, URL-003, URL-004
- Successfully discovered 18 build articles from LOMA Refined Shopify blog
- Target: https://www.lomarefined.com/blogs/journal
- Created scrape_urls.py using urllib and regex
- Pagination: 2 pages (9 articles per page)
- Article topics: Ferrari SF90, 12Cilindri, Purosangue, Roma, Lamborghini Temerario, Aston Martin DBX, Porsche 918, Rolls-Royce Ghost, etc.
- Pipeline status: expectedUrls=18, urlsFound=18
- **Learnings:**
  - Shopify blogs render server-side - fully scrapable with HTTP requests
  - Blog pagination uses ?page=N parameter
  - Article URLs follow pattern: /blogs/journal/{article-slug}
  - Test suite confirms all URLs are valid and unique
  - Low URL count (18) is correct - boutique builder with exclusive builds
