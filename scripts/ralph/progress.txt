# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-06
Project: MartiniWorks Build Thread Scraper

## Codebase Patterns
- Target site: https://martiniworks.com/build-threads
- Gallery has ~1,037 build threads
- Uses infinite scroll to load more builds
- Each build card links to individual build page
- Be respectful: add delays between requests

## Key Files
- scripts/ralph/prd.json - Task definitions
- scripts/ralph/progress.txt - This file  
- scraped_builds/urls.json - Discovered URLs
- scraped_builds/html/ - Saved HTML files
- scraped_builds/manifest.json - Scrape metadata

## Site Structure (from inspection)
- Gallery URL: https://martiniworks.com/build-threads
- Build types: Street/Daily (912), Show (327), Track (242), Drift (46), Drag (44)
- Has filters for: Year, Make, Model, Color, Wheel specs, Tire specs, Suspension
- Individual builds have slugs like /build-threads/[vehicle-name-slug]

## [2026-01-06] - US-001
- Created scraper directory structure
- Files created:
  - scraped_builds/urls.json (empty template for URLs)
  - scraped_builds/html/ (directory for HTML files)
- **Learnings:**
  - Git only commits files, not empty directories (html/ dir not in commit)
  - urls.json needs structured format: urls array, lastUpdated, totalCount
